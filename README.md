FileCheckerApp is a **free tool** designed to simplify comparing and analyzing files and directories. By using the first file or folder you provide as a reference, it contrasts it with a second, helping you identify similarities, missing files, or additional items.

## ‚ú® Main Features:

- Simple and easy to use.
- Clear results.
- Ability to export results as '.txt' and '.json'. (This feature is coming soon, and we will keep you updated.).

## üéØ Motivation

The original idea behind FileCheckerApp is to provide a straightforward tool for analyzing and comparing files and directories, such as documents, images, or text files, between two locations. Whether you're an individual looking to organize your files or a professional performing audits or backups, FileCheckerApp helps you make informed decisions and save time in your daily file management tasks.
