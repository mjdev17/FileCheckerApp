<h1 align="center">FileCheckerApp</h1>
<p align="center">Compare and analyze folders quickly.</p>

FileCheckerApp is a free comparison tool, created to make it easier to scan and compare similar files, common files and additional files in two directories.
This software takes file references from the first directory and compares these files with the second directory, thereby making a comparison and determining which are similar, common, or additional files.

Principal features:

* ✨ Simple and easy to use.
* 📊 Clear results.
* 💾 Ability to export results as '.txt' and '.json'. (coming soon).

## Motivation

The original idea behind this program is to provide a simple tool to analyze and compare files, such as documents, images or data, between two directories in a visual way. This tool can be useful both for individual users who want to organize their files, as well as for professionals who need to perform data analysis or content audits. With this tool, users will be able to make more informed decisions and save time in their daily tasks related to file management.
